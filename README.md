# Random place generator
## Overview
This is the front end for an application that randomly generates a city on Earth or a planet from the Star Wars Universe when a user clicks on the respective button. Data for the cities was generated from a CSV file downloaded from [Simple Maps](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities). The star wars planets are accessed through [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/), the Stars Wars API. This project was created as an added bonus to my Bucket List project as a place for people to look for travel inspiration.

## Features and Additions
I added the parallax effect to the background. I recently learned how to do this, and I think it gives the simple site an elevated look.
